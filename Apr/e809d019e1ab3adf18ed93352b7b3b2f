Bengaluru — Gold prices gained on Monday as rising coronavirus cases boosted the metal’s safe-haven appeal, supported by a weaker dollar as investors await this week’s US Federal Reserve meeting, while autocatalyst palladium was little changed after scaling historic highs last week.

So that is boiling demand for safety, resulting in higher gold prices,” said Margaret Yang, a strategist at DailyFX, adding that an easing dollar is further supporting prices. Cases in India registered a record surge, while Japan declared states of emergency for Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures on Friday to combat a spike. Speculators raised their bullish positions in Comex gold in the week to April 20, the US.
