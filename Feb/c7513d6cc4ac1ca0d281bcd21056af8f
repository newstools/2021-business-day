Nesi Chetty from Stanlib chose Hyprop as his stock pick of the day. “My pick is a company called Hyprop. It’s one we’ve been waiting to get into for some time now and I guess the discount to NAV [net asset value] and they’ve got an exciting retail portfolio based in SA, which is close to about R24bn.”
