The JSE faces subdued Asian markets on Thursday morning amid market closures, with local focus on the state of the nation address (Sona) later. Markets in mainland China, South Korea and Japan are  closed for lunar new year holidays, while activity was subdued in US markets overnight as investors digested lower-than-expected inflation data for January, said Oanda senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley in a note. “That took the wind out of the sails of the buy-everything trade, leading to another day of consolidation across asset classes,” said Halley. Locally, focus will be on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Sona, which could include details on how SA is combating the spread of Covid-19 and intends to combat the economic effects of the pandemic.
