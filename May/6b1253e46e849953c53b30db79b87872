Consumer inflation, which the Reserve Bank monitors closely when deciding on interest rates, rose at its fastest pace in more than year but remained within the Bankâ€™s 3%-6% target band. Consumer price inflation accelerated to 4.4% in April on an annual basis, up from 3.2% in March, Stats SA said in a statement on Wednesday. This is highest reading since February 2020 and was slightly worse than the Bloomberg median estimate of 4.3%. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.7% month on month in April. The main contributors to the 4.4% annual inflation rate were food and nonalcoholic beverages; housing and utilities; transport; and miscellaneous goods and services, Stats SA said. Food and nonalcoholic beverages increased by 6.3% year-on-year, and contributed 1.1 percentage points. Housing and utilities increased by 2.3% year-on-year, and contributed 0.6 of a percentage point. Transport increased by 10.6% year on year, and contributed 1.5 percentage points. Miscellaneous goods and services increased by 4.0% year on year, and contributed 0.7 of a percentage point. mahlangua@businesslive.co.za
