The JSE faces subdued Asian markets on Monday morning, with markets reacting to Chinese data, while  SA is bracing for the fallout from a third wave of Covid-19. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday SA would be moving to a level 2 lockdown as Covid-19 infections increase, with the  curfew tightened and  the number of people that can attend indoor events  reduced to 100. More-damaging restrictions, such as on liquor sales, have been avoided for now, but Ramaphosa said  that it remains unclear  how long or severe SA’s third wave will be. China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for May disappointed earlier, dropping slightly from the prior month to 51 points.
