Nick Kunze from Sanlam Private Wealth chose AngloGold Ashanti as his stock pick of the day and Gerbrand Smit from N-e-F-G Fund Managers chose Standard Bank. Kunze said: “I’m going to go with the AngloGold Ashanti, just from an inflation point of view, it’s a little bit of a tick up, it’s coming back in a little bit of a risk-off the last few days and I think something like AngloGold Ashanti ... is worth a stay at these levels.” Smith said: “I’m heading for Standard Bank ... It’s trading at a 1.1 price to book, which is probably the right way of looking at the banks. Its five-year median on that is 1.61, so I think it has about 30% upside from where it’s at the moment.” Or listen to the full audio: Subscribe for free episodes: iono.fm | Spotify | Pocket Casts | Player.fm
