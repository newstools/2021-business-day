Mia Kruger from Kruger International chose Apple​ as her stock pick of the day and Mark du Toit from OysterCatcher Investments chose Absa.

All our banks came out with trading updates over the last month and they have been broadly positive.” Or listen to the full audio: Subscribe for free episodes: iono.fm | Spotify | Pocket Casts | Player.fm
