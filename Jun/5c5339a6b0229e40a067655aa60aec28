Jean Pierre Verster from Protea Capital Management chose Pinduoduo as his stock pick of the day and Drikus Combrinck from Capicraft chose Zeder​. Verster said: “My stock pick is called Pinduoduo, it is a Chinese e-commerce business listed in the US and they focus on what you can call social commerce.” Combrinck said: “I’m going with Zeder, it’s come down a bit again in the last week or so and is sitting at about a 30%-40% discount to NAV [net asset value] and even the underlying investments are valued quite cheaply.”
