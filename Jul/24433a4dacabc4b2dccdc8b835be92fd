Gerbrand Smit from N-e-F-G Fund Managers chose Mediclinic as his stock pick of the day and Alex Duys from Umthombo Wealth chose Nedbank. Smit said: “I’m going for Mediclinic, we haven’t spoken about them for some time. I just think there’s life after Covid, these hospital groups are prices for depression and I think there some upside in some of them. Duys said: “Even though we’ve seen a recovery in the banking space, my pick is Nedbank and you’re looking at around a 9% dividend yield 18 months from now.”
