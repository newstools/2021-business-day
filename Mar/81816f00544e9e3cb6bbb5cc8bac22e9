Practising healthy money habits and adjusting how you do your everyday banking can stretch your money for your short and long-term goals. FNB is helping its customers better manage their money through cost-effective financial solutions, a range of safer banking channels, and value through eBucks rewards programme. FNB Entry Wallet CEO Zibu Nqala says: “We want to help customers by making sure our everyday solutions and services are helpful, safer and more convenient. Last year, we provided customers with significant rewards, especially on their everyday needs such as airtime and data, while also saving them money by keeping the monthly account fee flat to cushion some of the impact of the pandemic. We want to continue easing their financial burden by supporting them on their money-management journey to total control and stability for them and their families. “We’ve outlined some of the most common areas where customers can save on fees by using cost-effective alternatives to get value for money.” Transactional fees: Cash-related fees: It can be difficult to avoid using cash as most public transport such as taxis require it. However, there are ways to get cash safely and cost-effectively. Prepaid services/fees: “We pride ourselves in putting customers at the centre of our solutions and the incentives we provide show our commitment to value-based banking, especially during these tough economic times,” says Nqala.
