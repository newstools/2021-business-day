Graeme Körner from Körner Perspective chose ​African Rainbow Capital Investments (ARC) as his stock pick of the day and Gerbrand Smit from N-e-F-G Fund Managers chose Standard Bank. Körner said: “African Rainbow Capital released its results today obviously they did a rights issue a while ago and a lot of people are critical of the valuations of Rain and TymeBank. TymeBank now has 2.7-million customers, Rain is doing well, so with a 50% discount to NAV [net asset value], I really like that financial services portfolio.” Smit said: “I’m picking Standard Bank, they’re actually paying a little bit of a dividend and I think they’re still sitting at about a 30% discount to what they should be on the middle case scenario.” Or listen to the full audio: Subscribe for free episodes: iono.fm | Spotify | Pocket Casts | Player.fm
