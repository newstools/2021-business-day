Former Business Day political editor, Karima Brown, has died of Covid-19-related complications. The veteran journalist was laid to rest in a burial ceremony held in accordance with Islamic rites and traditions on Thursday. Brown had been a regular face and contributor on eNCA for nearly five years, hosting current affairs programme  The Fix since May 2018. She was  a political commentator on the channel since 2017. “For a long time, Karima has been a robust voice in SA’s media landscape,” eNCA MD Norman Munzhelele said on Thursday. “Her years of activism preceded this. She had a big personality and didn’t shy away from voicing her opinions. Karima believed in hope. She was also a loving mother, a loyal friend and a committed colleague. Her death leaves a huge void for many.” Her family described Brown as a  prolific and well-known  journalist and commentator “with deep footprints in print and broadcast media”. In a statement the family also said Brown  was a “well-loved friend, mentor, mother, colleague, daughter, and confidante to countless people throughout a life lived fully, and with deep commitment to her most cherished values and principles”. Her former editor at Business Day, Peter Bruce, said on Twitter: “Whenever I realised I was lost on an ANC story I would call or WhatsApp Karima Brown. She always had answers and understanding.”
